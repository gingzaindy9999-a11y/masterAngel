🌍 About This Course

This repository contains open, practice-oriented Jupyter notebooks for teaching Machine Learning, built with a strong balance between theory, intuition, and real-world experimentation.

The course is designed to take learners from ML fundamentals to modern deep learning concepts, using widely adopted tools such as:

scikit-learn – classical machine learning

Keras / TensorFlow – deep learning

OpenML – large-scale experimentation across datasets


All materials are free, open, and reusable.

🎯 Who This Course Is For

This course is ideal for:

Software developers transitioning into Machine Learning / AI

Data scientists who want strong foundations + practical skills

Educators looking for open ML teaching materials

Self-learners who prefer hands-on notebooks over slides


Basic Python knowledge is recommended. No prior ML experience is strictly required.


---

🧭 Learning Philosophy

This course follows three core principles:

1. Learn by doing – every concept is paired with executable code


2. Concept before complexity – intuition first, math when it matters


3. Open by default – reusable, remixable, and community-friendly
